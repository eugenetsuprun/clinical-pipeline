RE: Prior Authorization Request for Cochlear Implantation

Patient Name:  Jane R. Miller
Patient Date of Birth:  03/15/1958
Patient ID:  JM987654321
Insurance Policy Number: ABC-123-DEF-456

Dear Authorization Review Committee,

I am writing to request prior authorization for a cochlear implant for my patient, Ms. Jane R. Miller. Ms. Miller
is a 65-year-old woman with a long-standing history of bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, documented as ICD-10
code H90.3 (Sensorineural hearing loss, bilateral). She has experienced progressive deterioration in her hearing
over the past several years, despite consistent and appropriate use of optimally fitted hearing aids.

Ms. Miller's most recent audiogram (attached) reveals profound hearing loss in both ears, with speech discrimination
scores falling below acceptable thresholds for successful hearing aid use. Her pure tone average (PTA) is 85 dB HL
in the right ear and 90 dB HL in the left ear. She struggles significantly in daily communication, particularly
in noisy environments, leading to social isolation and a diminished quality of life. Her hearing loss is impacting
her ability to participate in social activities, work meetings, and even simple conversations, causing significant
emotional distress, which further supports the secondary diagnosis of ICD-10 F41.1 (Generalized anxiety disorder).

Given Ms. Miller's profound bilateral sensorineural hearing loss and the limited benefit she receives from hearing
aids, I believe she is an excellent candidate for cochlear implantation.  We are specifically requesting authorization
for the surgical placement of a cochlear implant, multi-channel in the right ear, which is identified by CPT code 69930
(Cochlear device implantation, with or without mastoidectomy). As a board-certified otolaryngologist specializing
in the management of hearing loss and balance disorders, and based on my examination and review of her comprehensive
audiometric and medical records, Ms. Miller meets the clinical criteria for cochlear implantation as defined by both
the FDA and her insurance policy.

It is my professional opinion that a cochlear implant is the most appropriate and medically necessary treatment option
to address Ms. Miller's severe hearing impairment. This intervention is expected to significantly improve her speech
perception abilities, particularly in noisy environments, leading to a substantial improvement in her communication
skills, social interaction, and overall well-being. We will also perform post operative auditory rehabilitation, CPT
code 92626.

We are also requesting coverage for the external sound processor associated with the implanted device. It is important
that Ms. Miller is able to have follow-up programming and adjustments of the speech processor which is designated 
with CPT code 92602 (Therapeutic service(s) for the use of a cochlear implant or auditory osseointegrated device,
per encounter, 15 minutes or more; programming of speech processor, subsequent reprogramming).
Failure to authorize this procedure would deny Ms. Miller the opportunity to achieve meaningful auditory rehabilitation
and significantly impact her quality of life.

Thank you for your prompt consideration of this request. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you
require any further information.

Sincerely,

Dr. Alan T. Nelson, MD, FACS
